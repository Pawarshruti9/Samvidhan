        "What are Directive Principles?": "Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP) are guidelines or principles given to the central and state governments of India, which they must keep in mind while formulating policies and enacting laws. These principles are enshrined in Part IV (Articles 36-51) of the Constitution of India. The Directive Principles were inspired by the Irish Constitution, which had in turn been influenced by the Spanish Constitution. They represent the ideals that the state should keep in mind while formulating policies and taking decisions.",

        "How are they different from Fundamental Rights?": "Fundamental Rights are enforceable in a court of law, while Directive Principles are not. However, Directive Principles guide the government in making policies aimed at social and economic justice, whereas Fundamental Rights focus on individual liberties.",

        "Why are they important?": {
            "Blueprint for Welfare State": "DPSPs provide a roadmap for establishing a welfare state and achieving social and economic justice.",
            "Constitutional Status": "Though not enforceable, being part of the Constitution gives them a special status above ordinary laws.",
            "Interpretive Tool": "Courts often use DPSPs for interpreting laws and constitutional provisions.",
            "Balance with Fundamental Rights": "The Supreme Court has evolved the doctrine of harmonious construction to balance Fundamental Rights with DPSPs.",
            "Legislative Guidance": "They guide Parliament and state legislatures in formulating laws and policies.",
            "Political Accountability": "Political parties can be held accountable by the public for not implementing DPSPs.",
            "Reflection of National Goals": "They reflect the aspirations, goals, and ideals of the nation."
        },

        "Historical Evolution of DPSPs in Judicial Interpretation": {
            "Initial Phase (1950-1970s)": "In early cases like State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan (1951), the Supreme Court held that Fundamental Rights would prevail over DPSPs in case of conflict.",
            "Middle Phase (1970s-1980s)": "In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973), the Court held that Fundamental Rights and DPSPs form the basic structure of the Constitution and neither can be destroyed. The 42nd Amendment (1976) gave primacy to certain DPSPs (Articles 39(b), 39(c), and Article 31C) over Fundamental Rights.",
            "Later Phase (1980s onwards)": "In Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980), the Court held that complete primacy of DPSPs over Fundamental Rights would destroy the basic structure of the Constitution. It established that there should be a balance between the two.",
            "Current Phase": "The Court now follows the doctrine of harmonious construction, interpreting Fundamental Rights in light of DPSPs."
