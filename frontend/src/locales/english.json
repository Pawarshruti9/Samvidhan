            "description": "The journey towards India's Constitution began long before its formal adoption. The fight for independence ignited the aspiration for self-rule, with leaders envisioning a legal framework that would protect citizens' rights and define India's governance. The first major step came in 1934 when the idea of a Constituent Assembly was proposed, gaining momentum after the historic Quit India Movement in 1942. Eventually, on December 9, 1946, the Constituent Assembly held its first meeting, laying the foundation for drafting the longest written constitution in the world. Over the next three years, extensive debates, discussions, and amendments shaped the final document, which was officially adopted on January 26, 1950, marking India‚Äôs transformation into a sovereign republic."

The Assembly was chaired by **Dr. Rajendra Prasad**, with **Dr. B.R. Ambedkar** leading the Drafting Committee. Over the next three years, the Assembly meticulously debated over **2,000 amendments** and held **11 sessions across 165 days**, refining every aspect of the Constitution. Their commitment resulted in a document that upholds democracy, fundamental rights, and justice for all citizens, shaping the foundation of modern India."

It also talks about four main goals:<ul><li><b>Justice:</b> Making sure all people are treated fairly in society, economy, and politics.</li><li><b>Liberty:</b> Giving people the freedom to think, express, believe, and worship as they like.</li><li><b>Equality:</b> Ensuring that everyone gets equal rights and opportunities.</li><li><b>Fraternity:</b> Encouraging a feeling of brotherhood and unity among all citizens.</li></ul> The Preamble was written by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and was adopted on <b>26th November 1949</b>. However, it came into effect on <b>26th January 1950</b>, the day India became a Republic. It was later changed by the <b>42nd Amendment in 1976</b> to add the words 'Socialist', 'Secular', and 'Integrity'.
